# Package Specification

This document defines the specification for a **Package**.  The
Package JSON document provides metadata about itself and in most cases should
provide sufficient information about the packaged contracts and its
dependencies to do bytecode verification of its contracts.

## Guiding Principles

The Package specification makes the following assumptions about the
document lifecycle.

1. Packages are intended to be generated programatically by package management software as part of the release process.
2. Packages will be consumed by package managers during tasks like installing package dependencies or building and deploying new releases.
3. Packages will typically **not** be stored alongside the source, but rather by package registries *or* referenced by package registries and stored in something akin to IPFS.


## Keywords

### RFC2119

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### Custom

#### Prefixed vs Unprefixed

A prefixed hexidecimal value begins with `'0x'`.  Unprefixed values have no
prefix.  Unless otherwise specified, all hexidecimal values should be
represented with the `'0x'` prefix.

* Prefixed: `0xdeadbeef`
* Unprefixed: `deadbeef`


#### Bytecode

The set of EVM instructions as produced by a compiler.  Unless otherwise
specified this should be assumed to be hexidecimal encoded and prefixed with a
`'0x'`.

#### Unlinked Bytecode

Unlinked bytecode is the hexidecimal representation of a contract's EVM
instructions which contains placeholders which are referred to as *link
references*.

* Unlinked Bytecode: `606060405260e0600073__MathLib_______________________________634d536f`


#### Linked Bytecode

Linked bytecode is the hexidecimal representation of a contract's EVM instructions which has hadd all *link references* replaced with the desired *link values*

* linked Bytecode: `606060405260e06000736fe36000604051602001526040518160e060020a634d536f`


#### Link Reference

A placeholder within the hexidecimal representation of a contract's EVM instructions.

`606060405260e0600073__MathLib_______________________________634d536f` the

In the bytecode
`606060405260e0600073__MathLib_______________________________634d536f`, the
substring `__MathLib_______________________________` is a link reference.


#### Link Value

A link value is the value which can be inserted in place of a link reference.


#### Linking

The act of replacing *link references* within some bytecode with *link values*.


#### Contract Type

This term is used to refer to a specific contract in the package source. This
term can be used to refer to an abstract contract, a normal contract, or a
library.  Two contracts are of the same *contract type* if they have the same
bytecode.

Example:

```
contract Wallet {
    ...
}
```

A deployed instance of the `Wallet` contract would be of of type `Wallet`.


#### Contract Name

The name found in the source code which defines a specific *contract type*.
These names **must** conform to the regular expression
`[a-zA-Z][-a-zA-Z0-9_]{0,255}`

There can be multiple contracts with the same *contract name* in
a projects source files.


#### Contract Alias

This is a name used to reference a specific *contract type*.  Contract
aliases **must** be unique within a single Package.

The *contract alias* **must** use *one of* the following naming schemes.

* `<contract-name>`
* `<contract-name>[<identifier>]`

The `<contract-name>` portion **must** be the same as the *contract name* for
this *contract type*.

The `[<identifier>]` portion **must** match the regular expression
`\[[-a-zA-Z0-9]{1,256}\]`.


#### Contract Instance

A contract instance a specific deployed version of a *contract type*.  All
contract instances have an address on some specific chain.


#### Contract Instance Name

A name which refers to a specific *contract instance* on a specific chain from
the deployments of a single Package.  This name **must** be unique
across all other *contract instances* for the given chain.  The name must
conform to the regular expression `[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]{0,255}`

In cases where there is a single deployed instance of a given *contract type*
package managers **should** use the *contract alias* for that *contract type*
for this name.

In cases where there are multiple deployed instances of a given *contract type*
package managers **should** use a name which provides some added semantic
information as to help differentiate the two deployed instances in a meaningful
way.


### Package Name

A string matching the regular expression `[a-zA-Z][-_a-zA-Z0-9]{0,213}`


#### Content Addressable URI

Any URI which contains a cryptographic hash which can be used to verify the
integrity of the content found at the URI.

It is **recommended** that tools support IPFS and Swarm.


#### Chain Definition 

This definition originates from BIP122 URI

An URI in the format `blockchain://<chain_id>/block/<block_hash>`

* `chain_id` is the unprefixed hexidecimal representation of the genesis hash for the chain.
* `block_hash` is the unprefixed hexidecimal representation of the hash of a block on the chain.

A chain is considered to match a chain definition if the the genesis block hash
matches the `chain_id` and the block defined by `block_hash` can be found on
that chain.  It is possible for multiple chains to match a single URI, in which
case all chains are considered valid matches


## Format

single JSON object.  Packages **must** conform to the following serialization rules.

* The document **must** be tightly packed, meaning no linebreaks or extra whitespace.
* The keys in all objects must be sorted alphabetically.

the `value` for this *link value* should be written.  This location is a
0-indexed offset from the beginning of the unprefixed hexidecimal
representation of the bytecode.

* The chain definition under which the *contract instance* that this *link value* belongs to must contain this value within its keys.
* This value **may not** reference the same *contract instance* that this *link value* belongs to.


To reference a *contract instance* from a Package from somewhere within the
dependency tree the value is constructed as follows.

* Let `[p1, p2, .. pn]` define the path down the dependency tree.
* Each of `p1, p2, pn` are dependency names.
* `p1` **must** be present in keys of the `build_dependencies` for the current Package.
* For every `pn` where `n > 1`, `pn` **must** be present in the keys of the `build_dependencies` of the package for `pn-1`.
* The value is represented by the string `<p1>:<p2>:<...>:<pn>:<contract-instance>` where all of `<p1>`, `<p2>`, `<pn>` are valid package names and `<contract-instance>` is a valid contract name.
* The `<contract-instance>` value **must** be a valid *contract instance* name.
* Within the Package of the package dependency defined by `<pn>`, all of the following must be satisfiable:
    * There **must** be *exactly* one chain defined under the `deployments` key which matches the chain definition that this *link value* is nested under.
    * The `<contract-instance>` value **must** be present in the keys of the matching chain.

To references a static address use the `'0x'` prefixed address as the value.
Package managers **should not** use this pattern when building releases that
will be published as open source packages or that are intended to be used
outside of a closed system.  Package managers **should** require some form of
explicit input from the user such as a command line flag like
`--allow-unverifiable-linking` before linking code with this type of *link
value*.


### The *Compiler Information* Object

The `compiler` field defines the compiler information that was used during
compilation of this *contract instance*.  This field **should** be present in all
*contract instances* which locally declare `runtime_bytecode`.

A *Compiler Information* object is defined to have the following key/value pairs.

The `type` field defines which compiler was used in compilation.

* Required: Yes
* Key: `type`:
* Type: String
* Allowed Values:
    * `'solc'` for the solc command line compiler.
    * `'solcjs'` for the nodejs solc compiler.

#### Version `version`

The `version` field defines the version of the compiler. The field **should** be OS
agnostic (OS not included in the string) and take the form of either the stable version
in semver format or if built on a nightly should be denoted in the form of
`<semver>-<commit-hash>` ex: `0.4.8-commit.60cc1668`.

#### Settings `settings`

The `settings` field defines any settings or configuration that was used in
compilation.

        * Required: No
        * Type: Integer
        * Format: Greater than or equal to 1.


### BIP122 URIs

BIP122 URIs are used to define a blockchain via a subset of the
[BIP-122](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0122.mediawiki) spec.

```
blockchain://<genesis_hash>/block/<latest confirmed block hash>
```

The `<genesis hash>` represents the blockhash of the first block on the chain,
and `<latest confirmed block hash>` represents the hash of the latest block
that's been reliably confirmed (package managers should be free to choose their
desired level of confirmations).
